# CampusConnectPlus

CampusConnectPlus is a mobile application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) that enables campus event management through QR-code check-ins, event details, and (planned) AI-based recommendations. The app serves as a gateway for students, faculty, and event organizers to create, discover, and interact with campus events—all with a smooth, cross-platform experience.

## Features

- **Event Discovery:** Browse a list of upcoming campus events.
- **Quick Check-In:** Use QR code scanning for efficient event check-ins.
- **Feedback & Ratings:** Rate events using interactive rating components.
- **AI-Driven Recommendations:** (Planned) Receive personalized event suggestions based on your preferences.
- **Cross-Platform:** Developed with Expo to support both iOS and Android seamlessly.

## Requirements

- **Node.js:** Version 16.x is recommended (versions 17+ might require the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag during installation).
- **Expo CLI:** For project development, build, and testing (use the local CLI via `npx expo`).
- **Git:** For version control and collaboration.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CampusConnectPlus.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
cd CampusConnectPlus
Install dependencies:
If you encounter dependency conflicts, use the legacy peer dependencies flag:
bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
Start the Expo server with a clear cache:
bash
npx expo start --clear
This will open the Expo Developer Tools in your browser, from which you can launch the app on an emulator, simulator, or physical device using the provided QR code.

navigation: Contains navigation configuration files.
screens: Hosts the main screens/pages of your app.
App.js: The entry point that bootstraps the application.
babel.config.js: Babel configuration, which includes necessary plugins for your project (like react-native-reanimated/plugin).
Usage
Event Discovery: Launch the app to see a list of upcoming campus events.
Event Details: Tap on an event to view more information.
Check-In: Use the QR code functionality to check into events.
Ratings: Provide feedback using the rating components.
AI Recommendations: This feature is planned for future updates.
Troubleshooting
If you experience issues such as dependency conflicts or module resolution errors, try the following steps:
Clear node modules and lock file:
bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
Re-install dependencies using legacy peer deps (if needed):
bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
Clear Expo cache and restart:
bash
npx expo start --clear
Babel Plugin Errors:
If you see errors related to missing Babel plugins (such as @babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining), install them as dev dependencies and update your babel.config.js:
bash
npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining
Then, in your babel.config.js:
js
module.exports = function(api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: [
      // Ensure react-native-reanimated/plugin is last
      '@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining',
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin'
    ],
  };
};
